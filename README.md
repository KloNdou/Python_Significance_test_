# Disease Element Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about a specific disease over the course of a year. The goal is to understand the significance of different elements related to the disease using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.

### Key Features
*Data cleaning and preparation
*Correlation analysis between disease elements
*Statistical tests to determine significance
*Visualization of relationships and trends

### Technologies Used
*Python
*Pandas for data manipulation
*NumPy for numerical computing
*SciPy for statistical tests
*Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization


### Analysis Performed
*Descriptive statistics of key variables
*Correlation matrix to identify relationships between elements
*Chi-square tests for categorical variables
*T-tests to compare groups
*Regression analysis to model relationships
*Visualization of distributions and relationships


### Future Work
Expand analysis to multiple years of data
Incorporate machine learning models for prediction
Analyze geographic patterns in the disease data
